## Here's What We're Looking For

Great schools start with a great principal who can lead the school, inspire their teachers, and motivate their students to be the best. The Principal is responsible for the instructional, business and organizational leadership of CHCS. The Principal is expected to achieve results, and in return they will receive a competitive salary, outstanding benefits, and great leadership development opportunities.


- Someone who thinks the best way for students to learn about trees is through climbing them.
- You can't be afraid to get dirty at our school. This isn't a school with sport-coats and ties. It's a school with mud-boots and raincoats.
- A commitment to the reality that all children can achieve academic excellence.
- Experience building an environment that celebrates great teaching and growing teachers.
- A business and an academic leader: someone who is as comfortable with a spreadsheet as they are in a classroom.
